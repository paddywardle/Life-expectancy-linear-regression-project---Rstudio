# Life-expectancy-linear-regression-project---Rstudio
The 'life_expectancy' dataset from kaggle was used to construct various linear regression machine learning models. This initially involved exploratory data analysis to gain insights about the dataset, finding useful aggregate statistics by countries and creating informative visualisations. Linear regression models were then trained based on various different features of the dataset. Using featur engineering techniques the best model was found, based on their R^2 values, demonstrating how much of the variation in data the model described.
